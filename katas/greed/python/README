This is an implementation of the Greed kata written in python using 
an object oriented + test driven development approach.

Python: 3.11.4
Packages: pytest, pylint

To run the application:
    python app.py

To run the test:
    pytest

To lint the project:
    find . -type f -name "*.py" | xargs pylint

When starting this kata my first question was how to represent the problem
in an OO fashiuon. If i was going to tackle the problem directly, I 
considered represting the dice values in a string. Very simple easy to
impliment. I decide rather to create a "Die" object that I could 
potentially use later on (Yahtzee kata?, or others). So this is the thought 
process behind this design decision. Also I could easily mutate the number 
of sides on the dice, which seemed like a big reusability point.
