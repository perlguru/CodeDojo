Extending:
    Should we use test setup and/or teardown? Same for class setup and/or teardown.

    Explore using @classmethods and class variables ("Hello, world"). Profile alternative methods.

    Perhaps we could take input like this:
    app.py --ask
        Who are you? > <USERNAME>
        Then print...
        Hello, <USERNAME>
       or:
    app.py --user <USERNAME>
        Print...
        Hello, <USERNAME>

Otherwise this kata is fairly complete.

Lessons learned (or exposed):
Very simple OOD (Not a lot to be impressed by)
Use of capsys in test
Perhaps profiling @classmethods may expose some efficiencies
Taking input, exposes arg parsing and input acceptance
