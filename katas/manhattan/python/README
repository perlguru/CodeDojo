This is an implementation of the Manhattan Distance written in python using 
an object oriented + test driven development approach.

When I read the kata the first time, I thought to myself, python does not 
support private variables or immutable class/instances. I did a little research
and found that these can be simulated. So I used @dataclass(frozen=True) to
accomplish the majority of the task and underscore+underscore to finish it off.

Packages: pytest, pylint

To run the application:
