Extending:
    Should we use test setup and/or teardown? Same for class setup and/or teardown.

    Consider dependency injection making the number part of the constructor.

    Explore using @classmethods and class variables. Profile alternative methods.

    Perhaps look at removing if's by creating a class "Number" that would explicatly
    generate "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz" as needed.

    Maybe even a class "Fizz" and a class "Buzz"?

Otherwise this kata is fairly complete.

Lessons learned (or exposed):
Very simple OOD (Not a lot to be impressed by)
Perhaps profiling @classmethods may expose some efficiencies
