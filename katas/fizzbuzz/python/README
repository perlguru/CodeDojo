This is an implementation of the FizzBuzz kata written in python using 
an object oriented + test driven development approach.

Since we use three methods to solve this kata, we thought it would be interesting to profile each method.
Profiling is taken care of in app.py, we have found that method 1 is 2x faster than method 3, and method 3
is 5x faster than method2. Method 4is slow as well being nearly 3 times slower than method 3. Method 5
(classmethod) is only slightly slower than method 1.

It should be noted that translate2 does do more work than the other 2 translates.

This may be a result of hardware or other factors. On my hardware it takes the entire profiling run 
approximately 10 seconds to complete. A large number of runs are needed to see a distinct difference
in the times.
