This is an implementation of the MineSweeper kata written in python using 
an object oriented + test driven development approach.

Python: 3.11.4
Packages: pytest, pylint

To run the application:
    python app.py

To run the test:
    pytest

To lint the project:
    find . -type f -name "*.py" | xargs pylint

I modified the input structure somewhat. 
I store the boards in tests/data/*.ms files. 
I store only 1 board per file.
The first line of each file contains the height and width of the board.
The next "height" lines contain mine/safe info where '* == mine, and '.' == safe
There is no need of the "0 0" termination line.
